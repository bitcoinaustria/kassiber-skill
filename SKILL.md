# Kassiber

Use this skill for Kassiber CLI workflows. Kassiber has its own command surface, so agents should not guess flags or reuse commands from analogous tools.

All `scripts/` paths in this skill are relative to the directory containing this `SKILL.md` file. Resolve `<skill-dir>` first, then use paths like `<skill-dir>/scripts/verify-state.sh`.

Kassiber accounts are wallet/reporting buckets, not a double-entry chart of accounts. Keep explanations simple unless the user explicitly asks for accounting theory.

Kassiber's CLI and daemon output are English and machine-deterministic, independent of any GUI language. The desktop app (`ui-tauri/`) is separately localized (English + Austrian German); the CLI is not. Don't translate CLI/`--machine` output or expect localized CLI responses. If you change UI strings in the Kassiber source repo, see `docs/reference/i18n.md` there.

## Fast Paths

Use these without opening extra references when the request clearly matches:

| User asks for... | First command |
|---|---|
| Current balances by account, bucket, asset, or wallet | `kassiber --format plain reports balance-sheet` |
| Exact summary totals, counts, fees, PnL | `kassiber --machine reports summary` |
| Check project readiness and report blockers | `kassiber --machine health` |
| Get deterministic next-step suggestions | `kassiber --machine next-actions` |
| Inspect the selected project's unlock mode and lease | `kassiber --machine operator status` |
| Discover an unfamiliar command contract | `kassiber --machine commands describe <command> [subcommand]` |
| Rebuild stale reports after imports/metadata/rates | `kassiber --machine journals process` |
| Largest inbound transactions | `kassiber --machine transactions list --direction inbound --sort amount --order desc --limit 10` |
| Largest outbound transactions | `kassiber --machine transactions list --direction outbound --sort amount --order desc --limit 10` |
| Smallest inbound transactions | `kassiber --machine transactions list --direction inbound --sort amount --order asc --limit 10` |
| Smallest outbound transactions | `kassiber --machine transactions list --direction outbound --sort amount --order asc --limit 10` |
| Ask the in-product assistant with tools | `kassiber chat "<question>"` |
| Run the fast local regtest harness | `./scripts/integration-harness.sh fast` |
| Run the live Bitcoin Core smoke harness | `./scripts/integration-harness.sh bitcoin-core` |
| Build the disposable full regtest accounting demo | `./scripts/integration-harness.sh demo-full` |
| Start/reuse the persistent regtest demo book | `./scripts/integration-harness.sh demo-up` |

If a fast-path command returns a structured error, inspect the envelope and take the hinted next step. For example, stale reports usually mean running `kassiber --machine journals process` once, then retrying the same report.

## Rules

1. Prefer `kassiber` when it is on `PATH`. If it is not, fall back to `uv run kassiber` or `uv run python -m kassiber` from the Kassiber repo root.
2. When falling back from `kassiber` to `uv run kassiber` or `uv run python -m kassiber`, keep the subcommand, flags, and operands identical. Only the launcher changes.
3. When the chat includes pasted Kassiber output or docs, identify the live user request separately from the quoted material before running commands.
4. Use fast paths for common read-only workflows. For wallet sync or other operations that contact configured backends, read the relevant reference first and avoid feeding raw command output into remote AI context unless it is documented as public-safe.
5. Before concluding a reference is missing, verify that you resolved it from `<skill-dir>` rather than the repo root or the current working directory.
6. If a command shape is unfamiliar, inspect it with `kassiber --machine commands describe <path ...>` or [references/command-templates.md](references/command-templates.md). If parsing fails before dispatch, use `--help`. Do not keep guessing positional versus flagged forms.
7. `--machine`, `--format`, and `--output` are global flags and must come before the subcommand tree, for example `kassiber --format plain reports balance-sheet`.
8. Use `--machine` whenever the output needs to be parsed or piped into later steps. It implies JSON and `--non-interactive`; if input is missing, handle the structured `interaction_required` error instead of waiting for a prompt.
9. Use `--format plain` when the user wants report output shown in the terminal. Let Kassiber format financial values; do not recompute or restyle them.
10. Use `--format csv --output <path>` for spreadsheet-style exports.
11. Never perform your own arithmetic on Kassiber financial values. Do not sum, subtract, average, or convert amounts from raw JSON when Kassiber already has a command or output format for the answer.
12. For current balances by account, bucket, asset, or wallet, use `kassiber --format plain reports balance-sheet` first. Do not detour through `reports summary`.
13. For rollups like totals, fees, counts, realized gains, unrealized PnL, or "give me the summary", use `kassiber --machine reports summary` first. Quote Kassiber's returned fields directly.
14. If Kassiber returns both BTC and `*_msat` fields, quote those fields as-is. Never derive one from the other in your response.
15. If the exact answer is not exposed by an existing Kassiber command, say that the CLI surface is missing it and stop there instead of approximating.
16. For "largest transaction", "smallest transaction", biggest inbound/outbound, or similar raw transaction rankings, use `kassiber --machine transactions list --sort amount --order desc|asc --direction inbound|outbound --limit <n>` so SQLite ranks the full dataset before limiting. Amounts are unsigned and direction is a separate field, so "largest inbound" and "largest outbound" both use `--order desc`; "smallest" uses `--order asc`. Do not fetch the default recent page and sort it client-side. If a machine response includes `next_cursor`, keep following it only when the user asked for the full list; a correctly sorted first row is already the largest/smallest row for top-N questions.
17. Processing order is: wallet sync or import -> review likely transfer / swap pairs when relevant -> `kassiber rates sync` when pricing is needed -> `kassiber journals process` -> reports.
18. Re-run `kassiber journals process` after any transaction import, transfer pairing, note or tag change, exclusion change, rate sync, or rate override before trusting reports.
19. Do not confuse `kassiber init` with onboarding. It only creates the local state tree; books records (`workspace`/`profile` internally), bucket, and wallet records are created with their own commands.
20. Prefer explicit workspace and profile flags until context is verified; these are the CLI names for the active books set and book. Use `kassiber context show` or `kassiber status` before assuming the active scope.
21. For Liquid descriptor wallets, require an explicit backend and private blinding keys. If either is missing, stop and fix that before sync.
22. If the user already provided a secret-bearing descriptor or token, do not ask them to paste it again and do not quote it back in summaries. Use a local file or direct CLI input once, then rely on allowlisted safe views after creation.
23. For wallet-connection setup, ask for the wallet or backend type if it is unclear, but otherwise assume a mainnet connection. Only ask about network when the user explicitly says testnet, signet, regtest, or another non-mainnet environment.
24. For desktop wallet or backend setup, prefer the Connections / Settings setup modals so users enter descriptors, file paths, and backend fields locally in the app. For CLI-only handoff, use placeholders or `--*-stdin` / `--*-fd FD`; do not collect descriptors, API tokens, or cookie values in chat.
25. If a BTCPay or CSV export belongs to the same real wallet as an existing Kassiber wallet, import it into that wallet instead of creating a duplicate wallet record.
26. On errors, inspect the machine envelope first. Kassiber success responses are `{kind, schema_version, data}` and errors use `kind: "error"` with structured fields.
27. Treat normal `backends ...` and `wallets ...` success output as safe-to-record only for secret-bearing config values. Do not ask users to paste raw backend credentials, raw private descriptor material, or suppressed config blobs into chat just because `backends get` or `wallets get` returns an allowlisted safe view.
28. For BTCPay and other secret-bearing backends, do not ask users to paste raw API tokens into chat. Prefer `--token-stdin` (then have them pipe the secret in locally), `--token-fd FD`, or — only as a fallback for older scripts — a local `backends.env` entry. The argv form `--token <value>` still works but warns and leaks to shell history; do not recommend it.
29. Do not persist backend or wallet config changes just to work around a sync failure unless the user requested that mutation or explicitly agrees after you explain the tradeoff. `wallets update --backend ...`, `--gap-limit`, and `backends set-default` change durable state. Preview automatic review mutations with `--dry-run` on `transfers bulk-pair`, `transfers rules apply`, and `source-funds links bulk-review` before applying them unless the user already approved the exact scoped result.
30. Never claim a BTC ↔ LBTC swap is already paired, carrying-value, or reflected in reports unless `kassiber --machine journals transfers list` shows the pair or `kassiber transfers pair` just succeeded and you reprocessed journals.
31. When quarantines remain, distinguish processed holdings from raw transaction-net estimates. Reports show processed journal state only; any netting from `transactions list` must be labeled as an approximate diagnostic rather than a Kassiber holding.
32. For rate coverage, do not infer the covered time window from `samples` or `days` alone. Use `kassiber rates range` with RFC3339 timestamps around the missing transactions.
33. Treat Kassiber accounts as wallet/reporting buckets. Do not recommend double-entry charts of accounts, automatic fee expense postings, or external equity counterpart accounts unless the product gains an explicit ledger model.
34. For planning or codebase work in the Kassiber source repo, treat `TODO.md` as the executable backlog and `docs/plan/` as orientation/guardrails. Verify current behavior against code before acting on a plan doc.
35. Treat `kassiber operator status` as the authoritative unlock-state check for an encrypted project. `brokered` is the recommended agent-work mode: a human runs `kassiber operator unlock --until-lock` in a controlling terminal, then same-OS-user processes share the capability-scoped in-memory lease. `manual` prompts per process or uses `--db-passphrase-fd`; `unattended` is the separate explicit `kassiber secrets remember-unlock` credential-store mode. Never switch modes or enroll unattended unlock merely to make an agent command succeed, and never ask the agent to see, retain, or place the passphrase in argv.
36. `kassiber secrets init` is a one-time migration from plaintext to SQLCipher. After it runs, the original plaintext file is preserved as `kassiber.pre-encryption.sqlite3.bak`; Kassiber refuses to overwrite an existing rollback file at that path. Advise the user to verify the encrypted DB opens (`kassiber secrets verify`) and then `rm` the `.bak` themselves once they trust the new file. Forgetting the passphrase means data loss — there is no recovery path and `.kassiber` backups do not help.
37. `.kassiber` backup files are `tar | age` envelopes that wrap a SQLCipher copy of the DB plus the attachments tree and `backends.env`. They are recoverable with stock `age` + `tar` + `sqlcipher` even without Kassiber installed. Backup decryption uses an outer age passphrase (`--backup-passphrase-fd`) that is independent of the DB passphrase.
38. The dotenv bootstrap (`backends.env`) is for non-secret addressing only: URLs, `KIND`, chain, network, batch sizes. Tokens, passwords, auth headers, and basic-auth usernames belong in the encrypted DB. If Kassiber warns at startup that the dotenv still has plaintext secrets, run `kassiber secrets migrate-credentials` (or `--dry-run` first) to lift them into the encrypted backends table; the file is rewritten with non-secret rows preserved and a `.pre-credentials-migration-<ts>.bak` snapshot is saved.
39. Use `kassiber chat` for the daemon-backed assistant when the user wants tool-aware AI help from the CLI. It is the only chat command and uses the same `ai.chat` / `ai.tool_call.consent` loop as the GUI. CLI chat is not broker-routed: while the project is in `brokered` mode it fails with `operator_chat_not_supported`; use direct brokered accounting commands, or have the human lock the lease and deliberately select `manual` before chat. `kassiber chat --no-tools` covers provider-only exchanges; `kassiber chat --stream-json "<prompt>"` emits the raw daemon stream records as NDJSON for scripting; `kassiber chat -` reads the one-shot prompt from stdin; `--transcript <path>` appends the public session records as plaintext NDJSON. Piped stdout carries only the answer text — progress and tool chrome go to stderr.
40. For scripted `kassiber chat` runs, prefer `--allow-tool <daemon-tool-name>` over broad `--yes`. Machine (`--machine`) and `--stream-json` runs never prompt for consent even on a TTY; there, and without a TTY in rendered mode, unapproved mutating tool requests are denied and fed back to the model as `user_denied`.
41. Chat history persists inside the SQLCipher database under the `auto` policy only when the DB is encrypted (`kassiber chats config --history auto|on|off`). `kassiber chat --continue` resumes the latest session, `--session <id>` a specific one, `--incognito` skips persistence once. Manage stored sessions with `kassiber chats {list,show,delete,clear}`. Machine chat envelopes carry `session_id` (null when nothing persisted).
42. For local regtest harness work, use `scripts/integration-harness.sh` from the repo root. `fast` is the no-Docker replay lane; `bitcoin-core` starts a disposable Core/Elements/Fulcrum/local-backend Compose stack; `demo-full` builds a throwaway full accounting book and proves the post-sync refresh path; `demo-up` keeps a persistent demo node/book and must leave reports immediately readable; `demo-tick [N]` adds fresh confirmed business activity to that persistent book; `demo-down [--purge]` stops or removes it.

## Gotchas

- Empty or stale reports usually mean journals have not been processed since the last change.
- Reports do not auto-pair BTC ↔ LBTC peg-ins / peg-outs or submarine swaps. If the user has cross-asset swap activity, inspect for likely pairs and use `kassiber transfers pair` before trusting reports.
- Use `kassiber --machine journals transfers list` when you need the exact transfer / swap links Kassiber computed. Do not infer them from `journals process` counts alone.
- `--machine` implies JSON and non-interactive mode. Use it alone or with `--format json`; do not combine it with another explicit format and do not expect it to prompt.
- A broker lease authorizes the logged-in OS user, not an individual agent. Any same-user process can intentionally use it; different projects keep independent modes, leases, keys, queues, and workers.
- Brokered commands that declare book scope require explicit `--workspace` and `--profile` flags. Do not rely on mutable current context for queued work.
- `admin` is never a standing broker capability. Broker-routed database administration requires a fresh passphrase through global `--operator-auth-fd FD`; never supply it in argv, caller-visible JSON, or chat. Direct revocation controls such as `operator lock` and queued-operation cancellation do not require fresh authentication.
- `wallets sync` uses either `--wallet <label-or-id>` or `--all`, never both; `transactions` needs the `list` subcommand and ranks raw rows with `--sort amount --order asc|desc`; `journals quarantined` has no `--limit`; `rates range --start/--end` expect RFC3339 UTC strings and supports `--order asc|desc`.
- `backends get/list` and `wallets get/create/update` intentionally return allowlisted safe views. Look for presence and state flags instead of expecting raw credentials, raw descriptors, or arbitrary config keys back.
- For new desktop wallet connections, default to mainnet unless the user says otherwise and use the setup modal flow. For CLI-only handoff, keep secrets out of chat with placeholders or fd/stdin forms.
- Quarantined transactions are omitted from accurate downstream reporting until resolved or excluded.
- Paginated list commands keep rows under command-specific keys such as `.data.records` and `.data.events`. Do not assume every list response uses the same field name; cursor state is mirrored uniformly under `.data.page` while legacy `next_cursor` / `has_more` fields remain available.
- Follow `next_cursor` only when the user asks for all/full/export/audit output. For top-N, largest/smallest, or summary questions, stop after the correctly sorted first page.
- Cross-asset `--policy carrying-value` pairing is Austrian-only right now. Outside Austrian books, BTC ↔ LBTC manual pairs still stay on the normal SELL + BUY path, so do not describe them as carrying-value.
- `kassiber status` may resolve to a legacy XDG path on machines with older state trees. Use status output, not assumptions, to find the live database.
- If `journals transfers list` reports `cross_asset_pairs: 0`, no cross-asset swap pair is active yet. Do not describe Austrian carry-value as already applied until that changes.
- Coinbase `rates sync` normally uses missing transaction minutes and cached checked-minute state before falling back to a continuous `--days` warm-cache request. Verify actual coverage with `rates range` instead of hand-mathing sample counts.
- If a skill reference lookup fails, the most common mistake is resolving `references/...` from repo root instead of `<skill-dir>/references/...`.
- Kassiber already has `reports export-pdf`; do not invent bespoke render scripts unless the user specifically wants a custom format beyond the built-in export.
- Accounts are not a double-entry chart of accounts today. `account_type` and `asset` are descriptive bucket metadata; fees and external counterparties do not auto-post to separate accounts.

## Data Model

Kassiber organizes data as:

`books set -> book -> buckets + wallets -> transactions -> journals -> reports`

Related notes:

- A **books set** is the top-level container for one local person, business,
  client, or related set of books. The CLI/API name is `workspace`.
- A **book** is one accounting and tax scope inside that set. The CLI/API name
  is `profile`.
- `wallet` is a transaction source that Kassiber syncs or imports; map it to the real underlying wallet, not every external store or export.
- `account` is a wallet/reporting bucket that wallets can belong to.
- `backends` define sync transport endpoints.
- `metadata` covers notes, tags, exclusions, and BIP329 labels.
- `attachments` are managed separately from wallet config and transaction rows.
- Cost basis is pooled per asset across all wallets in one set of books.
- Balance-sheet output groups holdings by the wallet's assigned bucket, not by account-type rollups or counterpart postings.
- If multiple BTCPay stores point at the same real wallet, keep them in one Kassiber wallet or holdings will be duplicated.
